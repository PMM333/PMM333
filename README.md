- I'm a graduate of West Chester University, Class of 2020. Master of Arts in Creative Writing.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my assorted story ideas.  I hope to become a published author, even a screenwriter.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about film history. I have a life long deovotion to the field and I just eat up any factoids I come across.
- ðŸ”­ Sometimes, I turn my writing skills towards recording what I've learned about the movies I love.
- ðŸŒ± When I'm not writing, I tend to build Legos. The only problem is making room for them in the basement.
